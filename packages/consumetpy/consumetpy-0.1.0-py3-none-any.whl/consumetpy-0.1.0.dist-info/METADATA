# consumetpy

A Python wrapper for the [Consumet API](https://api.consumet.org/) that provides easy access to the different categories and providers of the API.

## Installation

To install consumetpy, run the following command:

```bash
pip install consumetpy
```

## Usage

The package includes different classes for the different categories and providers of the API. To use the package, you'll need to create an instance of the `ConsumetAPI` class and then access the different categories and providers through its attributes.

    from consumet.py import ConsumetAPI

    api = ConsumetAPI()

    # Access the anime category
    anime = api.anime

    # Access the animepahe provider
    animepahe = anime.animepahe

    # Search for an anime by title
    results = animepahe.search('spy x family')

    # Get information about an anime
    info = animepahe.info('1')

    # Watch an anime episode
    watch = animepahe.watch('12321dqw')

You can access the providers, `enime`, `gogoanime`, `zoro` in similar way by using `anime.enime`, `anime.gogoanime` and `anime.zoro` respectively.
