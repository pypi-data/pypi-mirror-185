*Matplotlib styles and colours for Urban Intelligence*

This repo has Matplotlib styles and colours to format your figures for Urban Intelligence figures, scientific papers, presentations and theses.


Getting Started
---------------

The easiest way to install pyui is by using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pyui
```

The pip installation will automatically move all of the Matplotlib style files `*.mplstyle` into the appropriate directory on your computer and ensure the required fonts (Rubik) are installed.
