# Examples

## Images selection annotation

Annotation using `ImageSelectAnnotator`.

Define data to annotate with `ImageSelectAnnotator`:

```python
source_groups = [
    ["./surprized-pikachu.png"] * 16,
    ["./surprized-pikachu.png"] * 7,
    ["./surprized-pikachu.png"] * 8,
    ["./surprized-pikachu.png"] * 4,
]
```

Convert input data to `Sample`'s:

```python
from ipyezannotation.studio.sample import Sample, SampleStatus

samples = [
    Sample(
        status=SampleStatus.PENDING,
        data=group,
        annotation=None
    )
    for group in source_groups
]
```

Initialize database of your liking and synchronize it with your new input samples:

```python
from ipyezannotation.studio.storage.sqlite import SQLiteDatabase

db = SQLiteDatabase("sqlite:///:memory:")
synced_samples = db.sync(samples)
```

Configure & create annotation `Studio` to label your samples:

```python
from ipyezannotation.studio import Studio
from ipyezannotation.annotators import ImageSelectAnnotator

Studio(
    annotator=ImageSelectAnnotator(n_columns=8),
    database=db
)
```
