# Objectiv Bach: Pandas-like analytics modeling translated to SQL

Bach is a Python-based analytics modeling library with a Pandas-like interface. It translates all operations and models to SQL, running directly on your full dataset. All DataFrames & models can be converted to an SQL statement with just a single command, to use in other tools like dbt or BI.

Bach is part of [Objectiv](https://objectiv.io/), an open-source data collection & modeling platform that helps data teams run product analytics from their notebooks. Bach therefore works with any dataset that embraces Objectiv's [open analytics taxonomy](https://objectiv.io/docs/taxonomy/), so you can take pre-built models from the [open model hub](https://objectiv.io/docs/modeling/open-model-hub/) to quickly build deep analyses for a wide range of product & marketing use cases.


## Installation
To install Bach, use the following command:
```bash
pip install objectiv-bach           # just the Bach library, supports PostgreSQL out of the box
pip install objectiv-bach[bigquery] # for Google BigQuery support
pip install objectiv-bach[athena]   # for AWS Athena support
```
