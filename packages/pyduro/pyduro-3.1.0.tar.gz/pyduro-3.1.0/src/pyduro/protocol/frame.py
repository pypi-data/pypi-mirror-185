class Frame:
    """
    Defines a NBE communication to send request to the burner controller and receive a response.

    Args:
        serial (str): The serial number of the burner (this can often be found on a sticker somewhere on the burner).
            Note that this should be a 6 characters string. Any longer string will be truncated and any shorter string
            will be left padded with 0s.
        pin_code (str): The secret pincode of the burner (this can often be found on a sticker somewhere on the burner).
            Note that this should be a 10 characters string. Any longer string will be truncated and any shorter string
            will be right padded with 0s.
        function_id (int): The code of the function to run (0: discover, 1: get settings, ...).
            Note that this should be a number between 0 and 11.
            Also note that it will always be sent as a two character string ("00", "01", ..., "11").
        payload (str): The payload of the function.
            Note that you cannot send a request without a payload. This is considered illegal in the NBE communication
            protocol.
            Also note that you cannot send a payload larger than 495 bytes.
        app_id (str): The application identifier you want to give to the burner. This has no real use for Aduro's
            burners, so you can safely go with the default one.
            Note that this should be a 12 characters string. Any longer string will be truncated and any shorter string
            will be right padded with underscores.
            Default: ___pyduro___
        sequence_number (int): The number of the sequence. This will be used to check that the response matches the
            request. If none is given, this will always be 0 and you won't have any request/response matching check.
            Note that this will be a number modulo 99.
            Also note that it will always be sent as a two character string ("00", "01", ..., "99").
            Default: 0
        function_check (bool): Whether or not to check that the function is allowed or not.

    Attributes:
        app_id (str)
        function_id (int)
        payload (str)
        payload_size (int): The size of the payload.
        pin_code (str)
        sequence_number (int)
        serial (str)

    Throws:
        FunctionNotFoundException: If the given function is not allowed in the NBE protocol implemented by Aduro.
        PayloadToLargeException: If the given payload is larger than 495 bytes.
