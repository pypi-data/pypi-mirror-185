Description: 
        This package was inspired by the creators of nflscrapR and nflfastR and the tremendous influence they have had on the open-source NFL community
        
        The functionality of nflscraPy was designed to allow Python users to easily ingest boxscore and seasonal data from publicly available resourses, in particular, Pro Football Reference
        
        Hopefully this package builds upon the availabilty of open-source resources for the football and data analytics community
