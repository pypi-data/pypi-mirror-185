SNMPv2-MIB;sysContact;0;1.3.6.1.2.1.1.4.0;DisplayString;sys.contact;contact;;;The textual identification of the contact person for this managed node, together with information on how to contact this person. If no contact information is known, the value is the zero-length string.
SNMPv2-MIB;sysName;0;1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0;DisplayString;sys.name;name;;;An administratively-assigned name for this managed node. By convention, this is the node's fully-qualified domain name. If the name is unknown, the value is the zero-length string.
SNMPv2-MIB;sysLocation;0;1.3.6.1.2.1.1.6.0;DisplayString;sys.location;location;;;The physical location of this node (e.g., 'telephone closet, 3rd floor'). If the location is unknown, the value is the zero-length string.
SNMPv2-MIB;sysServices;0;1.3.6.1.2.1.1.7.0;Integer32;sys.services;services;;;A value which indicates the set of services that this entity may potentially offer. The value is a sum. This sum initially takes the value zero. Then, for each layer, L, in the range 1 through 7, that this node performs transactions for, 2 raised to (L - 1) is added to the sum. For example, a node which performs only routing functions would have a value of 4 (2^(3-1)). In contrast, a node which is a host offering application services would have a value of 72 (2^(4-1) + 2^(7-1)). Note that in the context of the Internet suite of protocols, values should be calculated accordingly: layer functionality 1 physical (e.g., repeaters) 2 datalink/subnetwork (e.g., bridges) 3 internet (e.g., supports the IP) 4 end-to-end (e.g., supports the TCP) 7 applications (e.g., supports the SMTP) For systems including OSI protocols, layers 5 and 6 may also be counted.
IP-MIB;icmpInEchos;0;1.3.6.1.2.1.5.8.0;Counter32;icmp.echo;icmp echos;count;;The number of ICMP Echo (request) messages received. This object has been deprecated, as a new IP version-neutral table has been added. It is loosely replaced by a column in the icmpMsgStatsTable.
HOST-RESOURCES-MIB;hrPrinterStatus;1;1.3.6.1.2.1.25.3.5.1.1.1;Integer32;printer.status;status;;;The current status of this printer device.
Printer-MIB;prtMarkerLifeCount;1.1;1.3.6.1.2.1.43.10.2.1.4.1.1;Counter32;marker.count.life;printed lifetime;count;;The count of the number of units of measure counted during the life of printer using units of measure as specified by prtMarkerCounterUnit. Note: This object should be implemented as a persistent object with a reliable value throughout the lifetime of the printer.
Printer-MIB;prtMarkerPowerOnCount;1.1;1.3.6.1.2.1.43.10.2.1.5.1.1;Counter32;marker.count.power;printed since power on;count;;The count of the number of units of measure counted since the equipment was most recently powered on using units of measure as specified by prtMarkerCounterUnit.
Printer-MIB;prtMarkerSuppliesLevel;1.1;1.3.6.1.2.1.43.11.1.1.9.1.1;Integer32;supplies.black;black level;;;"The current level if this supply is a container; the remaining space if this supply is a receptacle. If this supply container/receptacle can reliably sense this value, the value is reported by the printer and is read-only; otherwise, the value may be written (by a Remote Control Panel or a Management Application). The value (-1) means other and specifically indicates that the sub-unit places no restrictions on this parameter. The value (-2) means unknown. A value of (-3) means that the printer knows that there is some supply/remaining space, respectively."
Printer-MIB;prtMarkerSuppliesLevel;1.2;1.3.6.1.2.1.43.11.1.1.9.1.2;Integer32;supplies.cyan;cyan level;;;"The current level if this supply is a container; the remaining space if this supply is a receptacle.

The value (-1) means other and specifically indicates that the sub-unit places no restrictions on this parameter. The value (-2) means unknown. A value of (-3) means that the printer knows that there is some supply/remaining space, respectively."
