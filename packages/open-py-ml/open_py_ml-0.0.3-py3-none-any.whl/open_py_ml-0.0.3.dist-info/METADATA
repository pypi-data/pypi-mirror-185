<code>
class Brain:<br>
    """<br>
    A brain. An Artificial intelligence (AI)'s data and runner.<br>
    Data: First argument in __init__(), Data is for the training data key/values<br>
    Threshold: Second argument in __init(), Threshold is for the percentage of which the AI finds<br>
    That the data is simular enough to the input string of which it is accepted<br>
    NOTE: This only works with strings now.<br>
    """<br>
    <br>
    def __init__(self, data: dict or None, threshold: float):<br>
        """<br>
        Initializes a new brain.<br>
        """<br>
    <br>
    def forward(self, data: str) -> str:<br>
        """<br>
        Gives a string for the Artificial intelligence (AI) to process.<br>
        """<br>
</code>
<br>

As you can see, This is just the way the brain is organized.<br>
You can only just use this, and you would have A good time.<br>
But for quickly loading the brain. By quickly<br> I mean without having to load the file yourself with "open()"
<br> You can actually just use load(filename, threshold), and save(ai, threshold).<br>
Note that load and save just save with json.<br>
