Scythe is a library of tools that generate summaries of the data contained in scientific data files.
The goal of Scythe is to provide a shared resources of these tools ("extractors") to avoid duplication of effort between the many emerging materials databases.
Each extractor is designed to generate the sum of all data needed by each of these databases with a uniform API so that specific projects can write simple adaptors for their needs.

## Installation

Install using an up-to-date version of `pip` on version 3.8 or higher of Python:

```bash
pip install scythe-extractors
```

Each specific extractor module has its own set of required libraries.
Given that some modules have extensive dependencies, we do not install all of them automatically.
You can install them either module-by-module using the pip "extras" installation (e.g., 
`pip install scythe-extractors[image]"`),
or install all extractors with 
`pip install scythe-extractors[all]"`.

## Development/Contribution

If you wish to develop new features using Scythe, please consult the 
[Contributor Guide](https://materialsio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributor-guide.html) that will
walk you through installing [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) and the Scythe dependencies.
