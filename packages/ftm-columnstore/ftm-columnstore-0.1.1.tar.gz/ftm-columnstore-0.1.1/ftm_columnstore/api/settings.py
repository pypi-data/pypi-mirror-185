DESCRIPTION = """
The yente API provides endpoints that help you determine if any of the people or
companies mentioned in your data are subject to international sanctions, known
to be involved in criminal activity, or if they are politically exposed people.

`yente` is the open source basis for the OpenSanctions SaaS API. Its matching
and entity retrieval functionality is identical to the hosted API, but it does
not include functionality for metered accounting of API requests.

In this service, there is support for the following operations:

* A simple text-based search for interactive applications (``/search``),
* A query-by-example endpoint for KYC-style tasks (``/match``),
* Support for getting graph data for a particular entity (``/entities``),
* Support for the OpenRefine Reconciliation API (``/reconcile``).

The API uses JSON for data transfer and does not support authentication or access
control.
