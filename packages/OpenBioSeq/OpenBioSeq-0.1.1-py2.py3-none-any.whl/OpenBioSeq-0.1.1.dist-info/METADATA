**News**

* OpenBioSeq v0.1.1 is released, which supports classification and regression tasks on bio-sequence datasets. It inherited most features in [OpenMixup](https://github.com/Westlake-AI/openmixup).
* OpenBioSeq v0.1.0 is initialized.

## Introduction

The main branch works with **PyTorch 1.8** (required by some self-supervised methods) or higher (we recommend **PyTorch 1.12**). You can still use **PyTorch 1.6** for most methods.

`OpenBioSeq` is an open-source supervised and self-supervised bio-sequence representation learning toolbox based on PyTorch. `OpenBioSeq` supports popular backbones, pre-training methods, and various features.

### What does this repo do?

Learning useful bio-sequence representation efficiently facilitates various downstream tasks in biological and chemical fields. This repo focuses on supervised and self-supervised bio-sequence representation learning and is named `OpenBioSeq`.

### Major features

This repo will be continued to update in 2022! Please watch us for latest update!

## Change Log

Please refer to [CHANGELOG.md](docs/CHANGELOG.md) for details and release history.

[2022-06-09] `OpenBioSeq` v0.1.1 is released.

[2022-05-24] `OpenBioSeq` v0.1.0 is initialized.

## Installation

There are quick installation steps for develepment:

```shell
conda create -n openbioseq python=3.8 pytorch=1.12 cudatoolkit=11.3 torchvision -c pytorch -y
conda activate openbioseq
pip install openmim
mim install mmcv-full
git clone https://github.com/Westlake-AI/OpenBioSeq.git
cd OpenBioSeq
python setup.py develop
```

Please refer to [INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md) for detailed installation instructions and dataset preparation.

## Get Started

Please see [Getting Started](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) for the basic usage of OpenBioSeq (based on OpenMixup and MMSelfSup). As an example, you can start a multiple GPUs training with a certain `CONFIG_FILE` using the following script: 
```shell
bash tools/dist_train.sh ${CONFIG_FILE} ${GPUS} [optional arguments]
```
Then, please see [tutorials](docs/tutorials) for more tech details (based on MMClassification).
