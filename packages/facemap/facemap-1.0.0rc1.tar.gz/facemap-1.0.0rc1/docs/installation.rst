Installation
===================================

This package only supports python 3. We recommend installing python 3 with `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/download/>`_.


Pose tracker and SVD processing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For using tracker and svd processing, follow the instructions below:

1. ``git clone https://github.com/MouseLand/facemap.git``
2. Change directory to facemap folder containing ``environment.yml`` file
3. ``conda env create -f environment.yml``
4. ``conda activate facemap``
5. ``python -m facemap``

This will install and run the latest development version on github.

SVD processing only
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run the following for command line interface (CLI) i.e. headless version:
::

    pip install facemap

or the following for using GUI:
::

    pip install facemap[gui]


To upgrade Facemap (package [here](https://pypi.org/project/facemap/)), within the environment run:
::

    pip install facemap --upgrade


Using the environment.yml file (recommended installation method):

1. Download the ``environment.yml`` file from the repository or clone the github repository: ``git clone https://www.github.com/mouseland/facemap.git``
2. Open an anaconda prompt / command prompt with ``conda`` for **python 3** in the path
3. Change directory to facemap folder ``cd facemap``
4. Run ``conda env create -f environment.yml``
5. To activate this new environment, run ``conda activate facemap``
6. You should see ``(facemap)`` on the left side of the terminal line. Now run ``python -m facemap`` and you're all set.

Common installation issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have pip issues, there might be some interaction between pre-installed dependencies and the ones FaceMap needs. First thing to try is
::

    python -m pip install --upgrade pip


While running ``python -m facemap``, if you receive the error: ``No module named PyQt5.sip``, then try uninstalling and reinstalling pyqt5
::

    pip uninstall pyqt5 pyqt5-tools
    pip install pyqt5 pyqt5-tools pyqt5.sip

If you are on Yosemite Mac OS, PyQt doesn't work, and you won't be able to install Facemap. More recent versions of Mac OS are fine.

The software has been heavily tested on Ubuntu 18.04, and less well tested on Windows 10 and Mac OS. Please post an issue if you have installation problems.

Dependencies

Facemap python relies on these awesome packages:

- `pyqtgraph`_
- `pyqt5`_
- `numpy`_ (>=1.13.0)
- `scipy`_ 
- `opencv`_
- `numba`_
- `natsort`_
- `pytorch`_
- `matplotlib`_
- `tqdm`_
- `UMAP`_

MATLAB package installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The matlab version supports SVD processing only and does not include face tracker. The package can be downloaded/cloned from github (no install required). It works in Matlab 2014b and above - please submit issues if it's not working. The Image Processing Toolbox is necessary to use the GUI. For GPU functionality, the Parallel Processing Toolbox is required. If you don't have the Parallel Processing Toolbox, uncheck the box next to "use GPU" in the GUI before processing.
