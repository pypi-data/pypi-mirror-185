=======================
The napari Sphinx Theme
=======================

A Sphinx theme fork of the awesome
`pydata-sphinx-theme <https://github.com/pydata/pydata-sphinx-theme>`__
with the look and feel of napari.

This is currently a work-in-progress, but since it's a fork of pydata, all the
existing configurations and affordances are already available. Check out the
`PyData Docs <https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__
for more info.
