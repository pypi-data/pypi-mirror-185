# SurfWaveR - a GUI for Multichannel Analysis of Surface Waves (Rayleigh waves).
SurfWaveR is an open source project, initiated by SIIP lab IIT Bombay. It can perform dispersion and inversion (2D) of active and passive seismic data. 
I have used pyQT5 to build the GUI, the "swprocess" module to generate dispersion curves using various transform methods, and the "evodcinv" and "srfpython" modules to do inversion with evolutionary and Monte-Carlo Markov Chain algorithms, respectively. <br>
It is not completed yet, but I'm working on it.
