NAME
signal

DESCRIPTION
Module describing the Signal object. A signal is a part of a time drive starting from where a peak of light occurs,
ending either at the end of the file or at the next peak. The data, integrated data and potential fits of a single
signal are stored as attributes.

class Signal:
    """
    A signal object contains the data and information for one light signal found in a time drive.

    ATTRIBUTES
    :ivar start:            Starting time of the signal in the original time drive file
    :ivar name:             Name of the signal. Automatically generated, can be altered
                            by user.
    :ivar filename:         Name of the original time drive file the signal was taken from.
    :ivar peak_height:      The highest value found in the signal_data
                            (should be the initial peak at the start of the signal)
    :ivar peak_time:        The time point at which the highest value occurs
    :ivar total_int:        Total area under the signal curve, equivalent to the value at the end of the
                            integrated signal and the highest value of the integrated signal data.
    :ivar signal_data:      List of dictionaries containing (numerical) time: value datapoints.
                            Background corrected data with starting time set to t=0, from the time drive that the signal
                            was taken from.
                            Format example:
                            [{"time": 0.0, "value": 1.0}, {"time": 0.1, "value": 5.0}, {"time": 0.2, "value": 3.0}]
    :ivar integrated_data:  List of dictionaries containing (numerical) time: value datapoints.
                            Integrated signal data (from signal_data).
                            Format example:
                            [{"time": 0.0, "value": 1.0}, {"time": 0.1, "value": 6.0}, {"time": 0.2, "value": 9.0}]
    :ivar fit_data:         Initially, an empty dictionary. Once the integrated  signal has been fitted to a curve, the
                            fitted curve will be stored here as a list of dictionaries containing (numerical)
                            time: value datapoints.
                            Format example:
                            [{"time": 0.0, "value": 1.0}, {"time": 0.1, "value": 6.0}, {"time": 0.2, "value": 10.0}]

    METHODS
    fit_to                  Fits the integrated signal data to a curve.

        :param data:        List of dictionaries containing (numerical) time: value datapoints.
