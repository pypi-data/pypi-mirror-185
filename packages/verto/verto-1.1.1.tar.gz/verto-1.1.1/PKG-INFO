|Build Status|

Verto is an extension of the Python Markdown package, which allows
authors to include complex HTML elements with simple text tags in their
Markdown files.

Basic Usage
-----------

Verto allows for an author to quickly include images and content and display
them in a panel (similar to a Bootstrap Collapsible Panel) with the following
markdown:

.. code-block::

  # Example Header

  Example Paragraph

  {panel type="example"}

  # Example Panel

  {image file-path="http://placehold.it/350x150" caption="Example Image"}

  {panel end}

While Verto has many configuration options it can be used immediately
with little code. For example, if the previous markdown is saved in the file
called ``example.md`` then the following would convert that file and print the
output to stdout:

.. code-block:: python

  from verto import Verto

  text = open('example.md', 'r').read()
  converter = Verto()
  result = converter.convert(text)

  print(result.html_string)

Documentation
-------------
