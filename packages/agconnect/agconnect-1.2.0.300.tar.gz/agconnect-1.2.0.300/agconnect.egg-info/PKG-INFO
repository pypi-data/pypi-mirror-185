# Huawei AppGallery Connect Python Server SDK

## Overview

AppGallery Connect is dedicated to providing one-stop services for app creation, development,
distribution, operations, and engagement, and building a smart app ecosystem for all scenarios.
By opening up a wide range of services and capabilities, which are built upon Huawei's profound
experience in globalization, quality, security, and project management, AppGallery Connect substantially
simplifies app development and O&M, improves app version quality, and helps apps attract a wider
scope of users and generate higher revenue.You can access the services listed below.

This module contains Server SDKs for following AGC Services:

1.Auth Service
2.Cloud Function
3.Cloud DB

## Auth Service Overview

Auth Service provides an SDK and backend services, supports multiple authentication modes,
and provides a powerful management console, enabling you to easily develop and manage user authentication,helps
you quickly build a secure and reliable user authentication system for your app by directly integrating
cloud-based Auth Service capabilities into your app.

## Cloud Function Overview

Cloud Functions enables serverless computing. It provides the Function as a Service (FaaS) capabilities to
simplify app development and O&M by splitting service logic into functions and offers the Cloud Functions SDK that
works with Cloud DB and Cloud Storage so that your app functions can be implemented more easily. Cloud Functions
automatically scales in or out server resources for functions based on actual traffic, freeing you from server
resource management and reducing your O&M workload.

## Cloud DB Overview

Cloud DB is a device-cloud synergy database product that provides data synergy management capabilities, unified
data models, and various data management APIs. In addition to ensuring data availability, reliability,
consistency, and security, CloudDB enables seamless data synchronization between the device and cloud,
and supports offline application operations, helping developers quickly develop device-cloud and multi-device
synergy applications. As a part of the AppGallery Connect solution, Cloud DB builds the Mobile Backend as a Service
(MBaaS) capability for the AppGallery Connect platform. In this way, application developers can focus on
application services, greatly improving the production efficiency.
