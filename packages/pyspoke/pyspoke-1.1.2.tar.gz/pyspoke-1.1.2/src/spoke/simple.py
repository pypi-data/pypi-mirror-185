"""Synchronous wrappers for one-time async spoke calls.
These have a lot of overhead setting up the scheduler and
creating a client, so if you need a persistent connection
it's far more efficient to use the async methods.

These methods must not be called while another asyncio
event loop is already running in the same thread.
