Description: # `msdm`: Models of Sequential Decision-Making
        
        ## Goals
        `msdm` aims to simplify the design and evaluation of
        models of sequential decision-making. The library
        can be used for cognitive science or computer
        science research/teaching.
        
        ## Approach
        `msdm` provides standardized interfaces and implementations
        for common constructs in sequential
        decision-making. This includes algorithms used in single-agent
        [reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning)
        as well as those used in
        [planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_planning_and_scheduling),
        [partially observable environments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_observable_Markov_decision_process),
        and [multi-agent games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_game).
        
        The library is organized around different **problem classes**
        and **algorithms** that operate on **problem instances**.
        We take inspiration from existing libraries such as
        [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) that
        enable users to transparently mix and match components.
        For instance, a standard way to define a problem, solve it,
        and examine the results would be:
        
        ```
        # create a problem instance
        mdp = make_russell_norvig_grid(
            discount_rate=0.95,
            slip_prob=0.8,
        )
        
        # solve the problem
        vi = ValueIteration()
        res = vi.plan_on(mdp)
        
        # print the value function
        print(res.V)
        ```
        
        The library is under active development. Currently,
        we support the following problem classes:
        
        - Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)
        - Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs)
        - Markov Games
        - Partially Observable Stochastic Games (POSGs)

        near future (e.g., inverse RL, deep learning, multi-agent learning and planning).
        
        # Installation
        
        It is recommended to use a [virtual environment](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/index.html).
        
        ## Installing from pip
        
        ```bash
        $ pip install msdm
        ```
        
        ## Installing from GitHub
        ```bash
        $ pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/markkho/msdm.git
        ```
        
        ## Installing the package in edit mode
        
        After downloading, go into the folder and install the package locally
        (with a symlink so its updated as source file changes are made):
        
        ```bash
        $ pip install -e .
        ```
