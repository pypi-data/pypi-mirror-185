This will support our own research\nand allow other people to more easily reuse the code.\n\n### Main features\nfrenetic helps you to\n- select a road representation (e.g. Bezier, Cartesian, Kappa, Theta),\n- define an objective (i.e. road feature to minimise/maximise),\n- choose mutation parameters,\n- define an executor (i.e. target executor), and\n- trigger execution (for a certain time/number of iterations)\n\nBehind the scenes, frenetic will take care of creating random roads (in your specified representation),\nfollowed by a mutation phase with the goal of producing a variety of individual roads\naccording to the chosen objective.\n\n\n### Where will the Frenetic journey go?\n\nIn the future, we want to ...\n\n# How to use\n\nFrenetic\'s main modules are the `Frenetic` and `FreneticCore` classes.\n`Frenetic` is responsible for the execution flow.\n\n\n, `FreneticCore`\n\n## Reference\nFor academic publications, please consider the following reference:\n\nE.
