# frenetic-lib

## The Frenetic story
Frenetic is a search-based algorithm, originally developed as submission to the
[SBST 2021 Tool Competition](https://sbst21.github.io/program/).
Frenetic was very successful and turned out to be one of the best tools that year.

After the competition, we continued our development of Frenetic and adapted it
for various projects, including research on different road representations.
We noticed however, that the SBST tool pipeline (i.e. the execution flow) is geared specifically towards the competition and limits research versatility.
Hence, it was difficult to integrate a different driving agent or alter the execution routine.

Furthermore, in the 2022 iteration of the SBST competition, we also observed that several competitors built upon Frenetic and its road representation.
Due to its popularity, we decided to extract the "Frenetic-part" of our submission into a standalone library,
so it can be more easily developed, maintained and integrated in other projects.

As a result, we extract Frenetic into this own library. This will support our own research
and allow other people to more easily reuse the code.

### Main features
frenetic helps you to
- select a road representation (e.g. Bezier, Cartesian, Kappa, Theta),
- define an objective (i.e. road feature to minimise/maximise),
- choose mutation parameters,
- define an executor (i.e. target executor), and
- trigger execution (for a certain time/number of iterations)

Behind the scenes, frenetic will take care of creating random roads (in your specified representation),
followed by a mutation phase with the goal of producing a variety of individual roads
according to the chosen objective.


### Where will the Frenetic journey go?

# How to use

Frenetic's main modules are the `Frenetic` and `FreneticCore` classes.
`Frenetic` is responsible for the execution flow.
