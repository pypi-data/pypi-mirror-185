Like the way the `async` and `await` keywords work in the __C#__ language?\n\nNow they can. Just decorate or convert them with `acynkit.eager`:\n\n```python\n@asynkit.eager\nasync def get_slow_remote_data():\n    result = await execute_remote_request()\n    return result.important_data\n\nasync def my_complex_thing():\n    # kick off the request as soon as possible\n    future = get_slow_remote_data()\n    # The remote execution may now already be in flight. Do some work taking time\n    intermediate_result = await some_local_computation()\n    # wait for the result of the request\n    return compute_result(intermediate_result, await future)\n```\n\nBy decorating your function with `eager`, the coroutine will start executing __right away__ and\ncontrol will return to the calling function as soon as it _suspends_, _returns_, or _raises_\nan exception. In case it is suspended, a _Task_ is created and returned, ready to resume\nexecution from that point.\n\nNotice how, in either case, control is returned __directly__ back to the\ncalling function, maintaining synchronous execution. In effect, conventional code\ncalling order is maintained as much as possible. We call this _depth-first-execution_.\n\nThis allows you to prepare and dispatch long running operations __as soon as possible__ while\nstill being able to asynchronously wait for the result.\n\n`asynckit.eager` can also be used directly on the returned coroutine:\n```python\nlog = []\nasync def test():\n    log.append(1)\n    await asyncio.sleep(0.2) # some long IO\n    log.append(2)\n\nasync def caller(convert):\n    del log[:]\n    log.append("a")\n    future = convert(test())\n    log.append("b")\n    await asyncio.sleep(0.1) # some other IO\n    log.append("c")\n    await future\n\n# do nothing\nasyncio.run(caller(lambda c:c))\nassert log == ["a", "b", "c", 1, 2]\n\n# Create a Task\nasyncio.run(caller(asyncio.create_task))\nassert log == ["a", "b", 1, "c", 2]\n\n# eager\nasyncio.run(caller(asynkit.eager))\nassert log == ["a", 1, "b", "c", 2]\n```\n\n`eager()` is actually a convenience function, invoking either `coro_eager()` or `async_eager()` (see below) depending on context.\nDecorating your function makes sense if you __always__ intend\nTo _await_ its result at some later point. Otherwise, just apply it at the point\nof invocation in each such case. \n\n### `coro_eager()`, `async_eager()`\n\n`coro_eager()` is the magic coroutine wrapper providing the __eager__ behaviour:\n\n1. It initializes a `CoroStart()` object for the coroutine, starting it.\n2. It returns `CoroStart.as_future()`.\n\nIf the coroutine finished in step 1 above, the Future is a plain future and the\nresult is immediately available. Otherwise, a Task is created continuing from\nthe point where the coroutine initially suspended. In either case, the result\nis an _awaitable_.\nThe coroutine is executed in its own context, just as would happen if it were\ndirectly turned into a `Task`.\n\n`async_eager()` is a decorator which automatically applies `coro_eager()` to the coroutine returned by an async function.\n\n### `CoroStart`\n\nThis class manages the state of a partially run coroutine and is what what powers the `coro_eager()` function. \nWhen initialized, it will _start_ the coroutine, running it until it either suspends, returns, or raises\nan exception. It has the following methods:\n\n- `done()` returns true if the coroutine start resulted in it completing.\n- `as_coroutine()` returns an coroutine with the coroutine\'s results.\n- `as_future()` returns a `Future`.  If the coroutine is finished, the returned object is a plain `Future`,\n  otherwise a `Task` (as created by the optional `create_task` parameter). This is suitable for uses such as\n  `asyncio.gather()` to avoid wrapping the result of an already completed coroutine into a `Task`.  \n\nCoroStart can be provided with a `contextvars.Context` object, in which case the coroutine will be run using that\ncontext.\n\n## Context helper\n\n`coro_await()` is a helper function to await a coroutine, optionally with a `contextvars.Context`\nobject to activate:\n\n```python\nvar1 = contextvars.ContextVar("myvar")\n\nasync def my_method():\n    var1.set("foo")\n    \nasync def main():\n    context=contextvars.copy_context()\n    var1.set("bar")\n    await asynkit.coro_await(my_method(), context=context)\n    # the coroutine didn\'t modify _our_ context\n    assert var1.get() == "bar"\n    # ... but it did modify the copied context\n    assert context.get(var1) == "foo"\n```\n\nThis is similar to `contextvars.Context.run()` but works for async functions.\n\n## Event loop tools\n\nAlso provided is a mixin for the built-in event loop implementations in python, providing some primitives for advanced\nscheduling of tasks.\n\n### `SchedulingMixin` mixin class\n\nThis class adds some handy scheduling functions to the event loop. They primarily\nwork with the _ready queue_, a queue of callbacks representing tasks ready\nto be executed.\n\n- `ready_len(self)` - returns the length of the ready queue\n- `ready_pop(self, pos=-1)` - pops an entry off the queue\n- `ready_insert(self, pos, element)` - inserts a previously popped element into the queue\n- `ready_rotate(self, n)` - rotates the queue\n- `call_insert(self, pos, ...)` - schedules a callback at position `pos` in the queue\n\n### Concrete event loop classes\n\nConcrete subclasses of Python\'s built-in event loop classes are provided.\n\n- `SchedulingSelectorEventLoop` is a subclass of `asyncio.SelectorEventLoop` with the `SchedulingMixin`\n- `SchedulingProactorEventLoop` is a subclass of `asyncio.ProactorEventLoop` with the `SchedulingMixin` on those platforms that support it.\n\n### Event Loop Policy\n\nA policy class is provided to automatically create the appropriate event loops.\n\n- `SchedulingEventLoopPolicy` is a subclass of `asyncio.DefaultEventLoopPolicy` which instantiates either of the above event loop classes as appropriate.\n\nUse this either directly:\n\n```python\nasyncio.set_event_loop_policy(asynkit.SchedulingEventLoopPolicy())\nasyncio.run(myprogram())\n```\n\nor with a context manager:\n\n```python\nwith asynkit.event_loop_policy():\n    asyncio.run(myprogram())\n```\n\n## Scheduling functions\n\nA couple of functions are provided making use of these scheduling features.\nThey require a `SchedulingMixin` event loop to be current.\n\n### `sleep_insert(pos)`\n\nSimilar to `asyncio.sleep()` but sleeps only for `pos` places in the runnable queue.\nWhereas `asyncio.sleep(0)` will place the executing task at the end of the queue, which is\nappropriate for fair scheduling, in some advanced cases you want to wake up sooner than that, perhaps\nafter a specific task.\n\n### `task_reinsert(task, pos)`\n\nTakes a _runnable_ task (for example just created with `asyncio.create_task()` or similar) and\nreinserts it at a given position in the queue. \nSimilarly as for `sleep_insert()`, this can be useful to achieve\ncertain scheduling goals.\n\n### `task_switch(task, result=None, sleep_pos=None)`\n\nImmediately moves the given task to the head of the ready queue and switches to it, assuming it is runnable.\nWhen this call returns, returns `result`. If `sleep_pos is not None`, the current task will be\nput to sleep at that position, using `sleep_insert()`. Otherwise the current task is put at the end\nof the ready queue.\n\n### `task_is_blocked(task)`\n\nReturns True if the task is waiting for some awaitable, such as a Future or another Task, and is thus not\non the ready queue.\n\n### `task_is_runnable(task)`\n\nRoughly the opposite of `task_is_blocked()`, returns True if the task is neither `done()` nor __blocked__ and\nawaits execution.\n\n### `create_task_descend(coro)`\n\nImplements depth-first task scheduling.\n\nSimilar to `asyncio.create_task()` this creates a task but starts it running right away, and positions the caller to be woken\nup right after it blocks. The effect is similar to using `asynkit.eager()` but\nit achieves its goals solely by modifying the runnable queue. A `Task` is always\ncreated, unlike `eager`, which only creates a task if the target blocks.\n\n## Runnable task helpers\n\nA few functions are added to help working with tasks.\nThey require a `SchedulingMixin` event loop to be current.\n\nThe following identity applies:\n```python\nasyncio.all_tasks(loop) = asynkit.runnable_tasks(loop) | asynkit.blocked_tasks(loop) | {asyncio.current_task(loop)}\n```\n\n### `runnable_tasks(loop=None)`\n\nReturns a set of the tasks that are currently runnable in the given loop\n\n### `blocked_tasks(loop=None)`\n\nReturns a set of the tasks that are currently blocked on some future in the given loop.\n\n## Coroutine helpers\n\nA couple of functions are provided to introspect the state of coroutine objects. They\nwork on both regular __async__ coroutines, __classic__ coroutines (using `yield from`) and\n__async generators__.\n\n### `coro_is_new(coro)`\n\nReturns true if the object has just been created and hasn\'t started executing yet\n\n### `coro_is_suspended(coro)`\n\nReturns true if the object is in a suspended state.\n\n### `coro_is_done(coro)`\n\nReturns true if the object has finished executing, e.g. by returning or raising an exception.\n\n### `coro_get_frame(coro)`\n\nReturns the current frame object of the coroutine, if it has one, or `None`.\n',
