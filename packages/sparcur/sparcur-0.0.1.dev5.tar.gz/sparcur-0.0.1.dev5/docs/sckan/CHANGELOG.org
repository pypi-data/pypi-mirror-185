* PLAN 2023-08-04 :future:
- NPO hasInstanceInTaxon
- alpha :: NPO synaptic connectivity
- maybe :: NPO connections from composer
- stretch :: ApiNATOMY species variance for whole models where not covered by NPO
- if-needed :: vagus round 2
* PLAN 2023-05-12 :future:
- NPO partial orders
- vagus round 1
* PLAN 2023-02-10 :future:
- bugfixes
- maybe :: more connections from NLP
* DEV 2023-01-10
- protcur.ttl now includes values from the sparc simple page note curation workflow
* PROD 2022-12-02
CLOSED: <2022-12-20 Tue>
- ApiNATOMY add model wbrcm for real this time
* RC 2022-11-28
- ApiNATOMY added model pancreas
- ApiNATOMY aacar-6 fixed axon locations
- ApiNATOMY bromo replaced FMA ids with UBERON and ILX ids
- ApiNATOMY models now contain version information in the form of a
  checksum on their input model ([[./queries.org::#apinat-models][example query]]).
- ApiNATOMY schema change =inheritedExternal -> inheritedOntologyTerms=
  =inheritedExternal= still exists and may appear in some models,
  however ontology terms now only show up under =inheritedOntologyTerms=
  and are no longer included in =inheritedExternals=.
- NPO added ebm sparc-nlp (replaces ebm nerves)
- NPO removed ebm nerves
- NPO aacar added hasInstanceInTaxon axioms
- NPO kblad added hasInstanceInTaxon axioms
- Blazegraph/SciGraph loaded graphs now embed information about
  build provenance that can be used to identify the version of a graph.
  See [[./queries.org::#embedded-load-provenance-record][embedded load provenance record]] for examples.
