Analysis Modules
================

This is a list of all analysis modules provided by MAICoS.
Note that we do not have an example section in each module.
Instead, we refer to our :ref:`tutorial <usage-python>` and
:ref:`userdoc-how-to`. Once you understand
the basic structure that will be teached there you can work with all modules.
If not, feel free to raise an issue in Gitlab_ or as us on Discord_.
