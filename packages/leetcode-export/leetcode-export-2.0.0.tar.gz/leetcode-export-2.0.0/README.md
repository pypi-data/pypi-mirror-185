## Login

To download your submissions you need to log in your LeetCode account by providing the cookies. To log in using cookies,
get them from an existing session.

**Steps required**:

- Login in to LeetCode in the web browser
- Open the browser's Dev Tool
- Click on the Network tab
- Copy the cookie header that can be found under Request Headers in any leetcode.com request.

You can insert the cookie string that you have just copied in the interactive menu (recommended) or you can pass it as a
program argument when lunching the script, like in the following example:

```bash
python leetcode-export --cookies {COOKIES}
```

## Script arguments

The script accepts the following arguments:

```
usage: leetcode-export [-h] [--cookies COOKIES] [--folder FOLDER]
                       [--problem-filename PROBLEM_FILENAME]
                       [--problem-content PROBLEM_CONTENT]
                       [--submission-filename SUBMISSION_FILENAME] [-v] [-vv]
                       [-V]

Export LeetCode solutions

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --cookies COOKIES     set LeetCode cookies
  --folder FOLDER       set output folder
  --problem-filename PROBLEM_FILENAME
                        problem description filename format
  --problem-content PROBLEM_CONTENT
                        problem description content format
  --submission-filename SUBMISSION_FILENAME
                        submission filename format
  -v, --verbose         enable verbose logging details
  -vv, --extra-verbose  enable more verbose logging details
  -V, --version         show program's version number and exit
```

Using the interactive menu is preferred as it will avoid storing your cookies in the command history.

## Filename template arguments

### Problem description filename template

To change the format of the problem description filename, you can provide a template as a string when lunching the
script.

```bash
python leetcode-export --problem-filename PROBLEM_FILENAME

The template can contain parameters that will later be replaced based on the LeetCode problem information. The available
parameters are the following:

```python

```

Default problem description filename template: `${question_id} - ${title_slug}.html`

script.

```bash
python leetcode-export --problem-content PROBLEM_CONTENT
```

The template can contain parameters that will later be replaced based on the LeetCode problem information. The available
parameters are the ones used in [problem description filename template](#problem-description-filename-template) plus:

```python
content: str
```

Default problem description content
template: `<h1>${question_id} - ${title}</h1><h2>Difficulty: ${difficulty} - <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/${title_slug}/">${title_slug}</a></h2>${content}`

### Submission filename template

To change the format of the submission filename, you can provide a template as a string when lunching the script.
