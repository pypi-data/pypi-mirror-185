# Why?
I wanted a simple library to write small to moderate cli programs.
It only uses the standard library.

# Why not X?
## X = argparse
Its way more then what I need 99% of the time.

## X = click
I don't particularly like decorators.

## X = rich
I like pprint, but it always seems like to much

## X = typer
I've used typer a bit, but it never clicked with me.
