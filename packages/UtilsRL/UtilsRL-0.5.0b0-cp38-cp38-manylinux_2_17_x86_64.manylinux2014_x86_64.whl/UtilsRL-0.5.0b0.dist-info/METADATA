# UtilsRL

`UtilsRL` is a reinforcement learning utility python package, which is designed for fast integration into other RL projects. Despite its lightweightness, it still provides a full set of functions needed for RL algorithms development. 

Currently `UtilsRL` is maintained by researchers from [LAMDA-RL](https://github.com/LAMDA-RL) group. Any bug report / feature request / improvement is appreciated.

## Installation
You can install this package directly from pypi:
```shell
pip install UtilsRL
```
After installation, you may still need to configure some other dependencies based on your platform, such as PyTorch.

## Features & Usage
See [the documentation](https://utilsrl.readthedocs.io) for details.
