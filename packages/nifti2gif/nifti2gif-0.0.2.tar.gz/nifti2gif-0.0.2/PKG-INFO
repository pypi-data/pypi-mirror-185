NIfTI to GIF
============

The following repository is heavily based on `Gif your nifti <https://github.com/lukassnoek/nifti2gif>`_ package by `Lukas Snoek <https://github.com/lukassnoek>`_ . I forked the repository, and I pushed it to the PyPI repository, so that it is now available via the ``pip` command. See the PyPI repository of the ``nifti2gif`` project: https://pypi.org/project/nifti2gif/0.0.1/

Create nice looking gifs from your nifti (``.nii`` or ``.nii.gz``) files with a simple command:

``gif_your_nifti /path/to/data.nii``
