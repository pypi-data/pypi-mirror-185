```
```
print(w2n.word_to_num('millon millon'))
Error: Redundant number! Please enter a valid number word (eg. two million twenty three thousand and forty nine)

```
```
print(w2n.word_to_num('blah'))
Error: No valid number words found! Please enter a valid number word (eg. two million twenty three thousand and forty nine)
