livedings - A graphical frontend for mididings
.P
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
livedings is a graphical front end that allows you to monitor and trigger scene
changes.\& It runs as a separate application that uses OSC to communicate with
mididings.\&
.P
By default, livedings uses the standard Tk theme.\& Specify the -T option to
switch to a custom theme with higher contrast and larger fonts.\& See
livedings --help for more options.\&
.P
The buttons at the bottom of the screen can be used to switch to the
previous/next scene, previous/next subscene, and to send all-notes-off messages
(panic) on all output ports.\& It’s also possible to use the arrow keys to switch
scenes (up/down) and subscenes (left/right).\&
