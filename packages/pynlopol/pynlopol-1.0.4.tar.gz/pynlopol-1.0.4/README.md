# pynlopol

## Overview

pynlopol is a Python library for nonlinear microscopy and polarimetry.

## Quick start

pynlopol requires Python v3.6 or later. To run the scripts from the command
line, Python has to be included in the system path.

Install pynlopol using:

python -m pip install pynlopol

Your Python folder should now contain a PIPO analysis script under Scripts:
fit_pipo_img.py

and some test data under test_data:
RTT v1_4 PIPO - 11_51_23_.221_.dat.zip

Dragging the ZIP archive should start an example fitting routine.
