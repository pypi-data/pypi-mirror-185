## Terms that you need to know.
+ **capture** : 
Payment capture is the process to complete a credit or debit card purchase by capturing or settling the funds for the transaction. After the payment has been authorized, the capture request can be submitted by the payment gateway to the issuing bank either immediately or at a time of the merchant's choosing.

+ **authorize** :
Card authorization is approval from a credit or debit card issuer (usually a bank or credit union) that states the cardholder has sufficient funds or the available credit needed to cover the cost of a transaction they're using a card to complete.
