name: SRSGUI example project using an oscilloscope and a clock generator


# Specify Instruments used in the project
# A line that starts with 'inst' adds an instrument to be used in the project.
# An instrument is a subclass derived from Instrument class in SRSGUI package
# The first volumn after 'inst:' is the instrument name used in tasks and main terminal.
# The second column is the Python module or package that contains the instrument class.
# The third column is a instrument class in the module
# The fourth column is connection parameters.
# if given, the instrument will be connected using the parameters when the config file is loaded.

# A line that starts with 'task: ' adds a task to the project.
# The first column is the task name that will be used across the application as a dictionary key
# of the task, displayed in GUI Task menu for selection, and used in task result data file.
# The Second column is the Python module that contains the task class with relative path from the Task config file.
# The third column is a task class  that is a Task subclass in the module.
