# Base4096

A Base4096 algorithm is a specific type of Base4096 algorithm that uses a base of 4096. It represents numeric values using a set of 4096 characters, which can include the upper and lower case letters, the digits 0-9, and various special characters.

Base4096 algorithms are useful for a number of different purposes, including:

Data compression: Base4096 algorithms can be used to compress large numbers into shorter strings, which can be more convenient to store or transmit.

Data encoding: Base4096 algorithms can be used to encode data in a way that makes it more difficult to read or understand. This can be useful for data security or privacy purposes.

Data transmission: Base4096 algorithms can be used to transmit data over networks or through other communication channels more efficiently, by encoding the data in a more compact form.

Data storage: Base4096 algorithms can be used to store data more efficiently, by using fewer characters to represent the same data.

Base4096 algorithms can be used to encode and compress data that is stored on a blockchain, allowing for more efficient storage and faster transaction times. The compact size of the encoded data can also help to reduce the overall size of the blockchain, which can be beneficial for decentralization and security purposes.



<B>USE OR INSTALLATION:</B>

This script can be imported.  To import, you will need to install your package using pip by running the following command:

pip install git+https://github.com/ZCHGorg/base4096.git@latest

Then you can use :

import base4096

Otherwise, to run the script, you will need to have a Python interpreter installed on your system. You can then run the script by using the following command:

python base4096.py
This will execute the script and run the functions defined in it.

If you want to pass arguments to the script, you can do so by providing them after the script name. For example, to pass the integer 123 to the encode() function in the script, you could use the following command:

python base4096.py 123
This would call the encode() function with the argument 123, and the function would return the encoded string.

You may also wish to simply copy and paste the code directly into your own script.  Be sure to show attribution per the licensing requirements, please!

<b>Examples:</b>

For example, if you have defined the following functions in your base4096 module:

def encode(number):
    # Encode a number as base4096
    pass

def decode(encoded):
    # Decode a base4096 encoded number
    pass

You can use these functions in your code like this:

result = base4096.encode(12345)
decoded = base4096.decode(result)



<B>HOW IT WORKS</B>

The script takes an integer as input and returns a string as output. The decode() function takes a string as input and returns an integer as output.

The encode() function works by first initializing an empty string called encoded. It then enters a loop that continues as long as number is greater than 0. In each iteration of the loop, the function adds the character at the index number % 4096 in the alphabet string to the beginning of encoded and then updates number to be number // 4096. The loop terminates when number becomes 0.

The decode() function works by initializing a variable called decoded to 0. It then iterates over each character c in the input string encoded, starting from the end and working backwards. For each character c, it adds the value of alphabet.index(c) * 4096**i to decoded, where i is the index of the character in the reversed string.
