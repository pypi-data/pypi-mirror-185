# SYNTHETICFAKER

Introducing "Synthetic Faker", the new Python library for generating realistic and business-specific fake data. This library is an alternative to existing libraries like Faker, but with a focus on generating data that is specifically tailored to business use cases.

With Synthetic Faker, you can easily generate color, toys, songs, medical, entertainment, online shopping, merchandisem , etc related data. It also includes other data sets that are useful for testing and development such as phone numbers, emails, and more.

The library is easy to use and can be integrated into your existing projects with just a few lines of code. It also offers a wide range of customizable options, allowing you to control the type and format of the data generated.

Synthetic Faker is perfect for developers and testers who need to use fake data in their applications without using real data. It saves you time and effort by providing realistic and relevant fake data that can be used in testing and development environments.

You can find syntheticfaker on PyPi and on Github with the documentation for the usage. Give it a try and let us know what you think. We're constantly working to improve and add more features to the library.



# Install
```
pip install syntheticfaker
```

# Requirements

Create a yaml file in your local environment as given below.

example.yaml
```

metadata:
  columns: {"name": "varchar","surname": "varchar", "favorite_toy": "varchar"}

fields:
  name: first_name
  surname: last_name
  favorite_toy: macys_toys

```

Above example of yaml file includes metadata and fields. 
Metadata includes the column names with its data type.
Current version supports only Varchar and Integer data types.
Fields includes the type of value you want to assign to you column. Each column from metadata dictionary needs to be mentioned in Fields layer.
If a column is present in metadata and not in fields layer then it will create random values as per your data type i.e varchar 
or integer

```
from syntheticfaker import main

data=main.main_data('location/example.yaml', number_of_records_to_be_generated)
print(data.get_data())

```
```

from syntheticfaker import main

data=main.main_data('/Users/ninadmagdum/example.yaml', 5)
print(data.get_data())

```
```
