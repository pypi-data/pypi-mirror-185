# Etherstan

**Currently a project placeholder. Come back later when the first version is actually released for working code.**

Get all transactions from Etherscan direct to a simple spreadsheet.

## Searches supported

More functionality will be added on eventually. For now it can pull.
* Ethereum transactions by address
* ERC20 transactions by address

## Getting started

The easiest way to use this tool is to download it from pip.

```
pip install etherstan
```

It requires python 3.10 or later.

To use the command line scraping tools, you must include API credentials in a config file. Edit config.json to include your Etherscan authentication token.

Need help getting your token, instructions to create an account and generate a token can be found in the [Etherscan API documentation](https://docs.etherscan.io/getting-started/creating-an-account).

## Usage

Coming soon.
